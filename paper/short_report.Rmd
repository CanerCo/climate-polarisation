# Motivation
We combine **stance** (climate change) with automatic **sarcasm** and **toxicity** scoring to examine links to **polarisation**.


# Data & Models
- **TweetEval (stance_climate)**: labels {none, against, favor}.
- **CardiffNLP irony**: roBERTa-based binary irony model.
- **Detoxify (unbiased)**: toxicity, insult, identity attack, etc.


# Methods
1. Python infers sarcasm and toxicity for each tweet; export tidy CSV.
2. R: (i) descriptive group means; (ii) logit (extreme vs neutral) and multinomial models; (iii) ER-style polarisation proxy over stance distribution with bootstrap CIs.


# Results (fill with your run)
- Q1 (sarcasm by stance): include Figure 1.
- Q2 (toxicity → extremity): include Figure 2.
- Q3 (stance polarisation): include Figure 3 + ER value and CI.


# Robustness & Notes
- Removing neutrals; scaling predictors; alternative ER parameters (α).
- Cautions: small dataset; domain shift; model error.


# Reproducibility
